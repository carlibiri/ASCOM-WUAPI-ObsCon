An ASCOM Observing Conditions driver that gets its information from Weather Underground.

An extension of Chris Rowland's idea to populate an ASCOM Observing Conditions interface with data from a weather API, 
rather than from phycially connected hardware and sensors, which utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API.</p>

I felt there was an opportunity for this version, which uses the Weather Underground API, for 3 reasons :

More observing stations to choose from

Many of OWM's staitons update only hourly.

Uploading to OWM requires user ability to control and direct the station's activities.  If the user had this ability, they would not 
need to use OWM to store the data, and could instead feed sensor readings straight to the ASCOM driver themselves.

Users require only their preferred Station ID to configure the driver.
