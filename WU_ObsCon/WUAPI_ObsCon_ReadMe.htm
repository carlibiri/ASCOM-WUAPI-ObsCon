<p>ASCOM Observing Conditions Weather Underground API driver : V 1.1.0</p>
<hr>
<p>Setup requires only 2 steps : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href=https://www.wunderground.com/>https://www.wunderground.com/</a> and select your desired weather reporting station.  Copy that station's Station ID from its page or the URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch the driver configuration page from your client before connecting, and enter that station ID into the appropriate box.  You'll only have to do this once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Once configured, connect to the driver, and enable whatever view your client offers for observing conditions.  The driver attempts to refresh data every 30s.  Actual refresh rate is dependent on the submitting station.</p>
